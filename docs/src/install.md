# Installation

### HierarchicalEOM.jl
To install `HierarchicalEOM.jl`, run the following commands inside Julia's interactive session (also known as REPL):
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("HierarchicalEOM")
```
Alternatively, this can also be done in Julia's [Pkg REPL](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/getting-started/) by pressing the key `]` in the REPL to use the package mode, and then type the following command:
```julia-REPL
(1.10) pkg> add HierarchicalEOM
```
More information about `Julia`'s package manager can be found at [`Pkg.jl`](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/).  
!!! note "Julia 1.10"
    `HierarchicalEOM.jl` requires Julia 1.10 or higher (we dropped Julia 1.9 since ver.2.1.0)

To load the package and check the version information, use either [`HierarchicalEOM.versioninfo()`](@ref) or [`HierarchicalEOM.about()`](@ref), namely
```julia
using HierarchicalEOM
HierarchicalEOM.versioninfo()
HierarchicalEOM.about()
```

### [QuantumToolbox.jl](https://github.com/qutip/QuantumToolbox.jl)
`HierarchicalEOM.jl` is built upon `QuantumToolbox.jl`, which is a cutting-edge Julia package designed for quantum physics simulations, closely emulating the popular Python [`QuTiP`](https://qutip.org/) package. It provides many useful functions to create arbitrary quantum states and operators which can be combined in all the expected ways. It uniquely combines the simplicity and power of Julia with advanced features like GPU acceleration and distributed computing, making simulation of quantum systems more accessible and efficient.
!!! note "Note" 
    Start from `HierarchicalEOM v2.0.0+`, the inputs states and operators must be in the type of `QuantumObject` (defined in `QuantumToolbox`)

### Other Useful Packages
In order to get a better experience and take full advantage of `HierarchicalEOM`, we recommend to install the following external packages:

#### [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/)
`DifferentialEquations` is needed to provide the low-level ODE `alg`orithms especially for solving [time evolution](@ref doc-Time-Evolution). For [low dependency usage](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/features/low_dep/), users can use [`OrdinaryDiffEq.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl) instead.

#### [LinearSolve.jl](http://linearsolve.sciml.ai/stable/)
`LinearSolve` is a unified interface for the linear solving packages of Julia. It interfaces with other packages of the Julia ecosystem to make it easier to test alternative solver packages and pass small types to control algorithm swapping. It is needed to provide the `alg`orithms especially for solving [stationary state](@ref doc-Stationary-State) and [spectra](@ref doc-Spectrum) for both bosonic and fermionic systems.

#### [JLD2.jl](https://juliaio.github.io/JLD2.jl/stable/)
`JLD2` saves and loads Julia data structures in a format comprising a subset of HDF5. Because the size of matrix in `HierarchicalEOM` is usually super large and leads to long time calculation, we support the functionality for saving and loading the `HierarchicalEOM`-type objects into files by `JLD2 >= 0.4.23`.

#### [PyPlot.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyPlot.jl)
`PyPlot.jl` provides a Julia interface to the [`Matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) plotting library from `Python`, and specifically to the `matplotlib.pyplot` module.

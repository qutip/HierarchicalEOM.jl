# [Extension for CUDA.jl](@id doc-ext-CUDA)

This is an extension to support GPU ([`CUDA.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl)) acceleration for solving the [time evolution](@ref doc-Time-Evolution) and [spectra](@ref doc-Spectrum). This improves the execution time and memory usage especially when the HEOMLS matrix is super large.

The functions of calculating [time evolution](@ref doc-Time-Evolution) (only supports ODE method with time-independent system Hamiltonian) and [spectra](@ref doc-Spectrum) will automatically choose to solve on CPU or GPU depend on the type of the sparse matrix in `M::AbstractHEOMLSMatrix` objects (i.e., the type of the field `M.data`). 

```julia
typeof(M.data) <:   SparseMatrixCSC # solve on CPU
typeof(M.data) <: CuSparseMatrixCSC # solve on GPU
```

We wrapped several functions in CUDA and CUDA.CUSPARSE in order to not only converting QuantumObject.data into GPU arrays, but also changing the element type and word size (32 and 64) since some of the GPUs perform better in 32-bit. The functions are listed as follows (where input A is a QuantumObject):

Therefore, we wrapped several functions in `CUDA` and `CUDA.CUSPARSE` in order to not only converting a HEOMLS-matrix-type object into GPU arrays, but also changing the element type and word size (`32` and `64`) since some of the GPUs perform better in `32`-bit. The functions are listed as follows (where input `M` is a `AbstractHEOMLSMatrix`):
- `cu(M, word_size=64)` : Translate `M.data` into CUDA arrays with specified `word_size` (default to `64`).
- `CuSparseMatrixCSC{T}(M)` : Translate `M.data` into the type `CuSparseMatrixCSC{T, Int32}`

### Demonstration

The extension will be automatically loaded if user imports the package `CUDA.jl` :

```julia
using HierarchicalEOM
using CUDA
CUDA.allowscalar(false) # Avoid unexpected scalar indexing
```

### Setup

Here, we demonstrate this extension by using the example of [the single-impurity Anderson model](https://qutip.org/qutip-julia-tutorials/HierarchicalEOM.jl/SIAM.html).

```julia
ϵ  = -5
U  = 10
Γ  = 2
μ  = 0
W  = 10
kT = 0.5
N  = 5
tier  = 3

tlist = 0:0.1:10
ωlist = -10:1:10

σm = sigmam()
σz = sigmaz()
II = qeye(2)
d_up = tensor(     σm, II)
d_dn = tensor(-1 * σz, σm)
ψ0   = tensor(basis(2, 0), basis(2, 0))
Hsys = ϵ * (d_up' * d_up + d_dn' * d_dn) + U * (d_up' * d_up * d_dn' * d_dn)

bath_up = Fermion_Lorentz_Pade(d_up, Γ, μ, W, kT, N)
bath_dn = Fermion_Lorentz_Pade(d_dn, Γ, μ, W, kT, N)
bath_list = [bath_up, bath_dn]

# even HEOMLS matrix
M_even_cpu = M_Fermion(Hsys, tier, bath_list)
M_even_gpu = cu(M_even_cpu, word_size = 32)

# odd HEOMLS matrix
M_odd_cpu  = M_Fermion(Hsys, tier, bath_list, ODD)
M_odd_gpu  = cu(M_odd_cpu, word_size = 32)
```

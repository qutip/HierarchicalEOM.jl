# HierarchicalEOM.jl: An efficient Julia framework for Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) in open quantum systems

`HierarchicalEOM.jl` is a numerical framework written in [`Julia`](https://julialang.org/). It provides a user-friendly and efficient tool based on hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach to simulate complex open quantum systems, including non-Markovian effects due to non-perturbative interaction with one (or multiple) environment(s). It is built upon [`QuantumToolbox.jl`](https://github.com/qutip/QuantumToolbox.jl).

While integrating many of the features present in other open-source HEOM packages, `HierarchicalEOM.jl` also includes new functionalities, such as the construction of even- and odd-parity [HEOM Liouvillian superoperator (HEOMLS) matrices](@ref doc-HEOMLS-Matrix), the estimation of [importance values](@ref doc-Importance-Value-and-Threshold) for all [auxiliary density operators (ADOs)](@ref doc-ADOs), [lazy operator memory optimization](@ref doc-Lazy-Operators) for large-scale systems, and the calculation of [spectra](@ref doc-Spectrum) for both bosonic and fermionic systems. 

By wrapping some functions from other [`Julia`](https://julialang.org/) packages ([`DifferentialEquations.jl`](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/), [`LinearSolve.jl`](http://linearsolve.sciml.ai/stable/), [`fastExpm.jl`](https://github.com/fmentink/FastExpm.jl), and [`SciMLOperators.jl`](https://github.com/SciML/SciMLOperators.jl)), `HierarchicalEOM.jl` collects different methods and could further optimize the computation for the [stationary state](@ref doc-Stationary-State), and the [time evolution](@ref doc-Time-Evolution) of all [ADOs](@ref doc-ADOs). The [lazy operator feature](@ref doc-Lazy-Operators) enables memory-efficient representation of HEOMLS matrices, with memory savings proportional to the number of ADOs, making it possible to simulate larger systems with higher hierarchy tiers. The required handling of the [ADOs](@ref doc-ADOs) multi-indexes is achieved through a user-friendly interface called [Hierarchy Dictionary](@ref doc-Hierarchy-Dictionary).
